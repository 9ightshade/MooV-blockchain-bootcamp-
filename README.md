üöÄ Quick Start

First workshop 
Use the Leo CLI to create a new project

# create a new `hello-world` Leo project
leo new helloworld
cd helloworld

# build & setup & prove & verify
leo run main 0u32 1u32
leo deploy --network tesnet
The leo new command creates a new Leo project with a given name.
The leo deploy command deploys the program to the blockchain so gas fee is required.
The leo run command will compile the program into Aleo instructions and run it.

Congratulations! You've just run your first Leo program.
